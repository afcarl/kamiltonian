    """
    Computes the incomplete Cholesky factorisation of the kernel matrix defined
    by samples X and a given kernel. The kernel is evaluated on-the-fly.
    The optional power parameter is used to multiply the kernel output with
    itself.
    
    Original code from "Kernel Methods for Pattern Analysis" by Shawe-Taylor and
    Cristianini.
    Modified to compute kernel on the fly, to use kernels multiplied with 
    themselves (tensor product), and optimised speed via using vector
    operations and not pre-allocate full kernel matrix memory, but rather
    allocate memory of low-rank kernel block-wise
    Changes by Heiko Strathmann
    
    parameters:
    X         - List of input vectors to evaluate kernel on
    kernel    - A kernel function that takes one or two 2d-arrays and computes
                the kernel self- or cross-similarities.
                Returns a psd kernel matrix
    eta       - Precision cutoff parameter for the low-rank approximation.
                If lies is (0,1), where smaller means more accurate, low rank
                dimension is chosen from a residual value
                If lies in [1,\infty), this low-rank dimension is chosen
    power     - Every kernel evaluation is multiplied with itself this number
                of times.
    blocksize - Tuning parameter for speed, determines how rows elements are
                allocated in a block for the (growing) kernel matrix. Larger
                means faster algorithm (to some extend if low rank dimension
                is larger than blocksize)
    
    Output: dictionary with key-value pairs:
    R    - is a low-rank factor such that R.T.dot(R) approximates the
           original K
    K_chol, ell, I, R, W, where
    K    - is the kernel using only the pivot index features
    I    - is a vector containing the pivots used to compute K_chol
    W    - is a matrix such that W.T.dot(K_chol.dot(W)) approximates the
           original K
    nu   - vector of square rooted residuals for the pivoted points
